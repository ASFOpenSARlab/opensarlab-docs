# Managing Jupyter Notebook Extensions
As an OpenSARlab user, you have access to all of the notebook extensions available in the nbextensions package. A detailed list of included extensions is available [here](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions.html).

## Enabling and Disabling Extensions

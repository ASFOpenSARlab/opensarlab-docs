# Creating and Using Conda Environments in OpenSARlab

Users can create conda environments in OpenSARlab, and use them to run Jupyter Notebooks. 

* Store environments in the /home/jovyan/.local directory so they persist after server shutdown
* Install the ipykernel to allow Jupyter Notebooks to run in the environment
* Restart the server after ipykernel installation

# Run the Jupyter_Conda_Environments for Additional Guidance

* [Jupyter_Conda_Environments.ipynb](../../OpenSARlab_supplements/Jupyter_Conda_Environments.ipynb)

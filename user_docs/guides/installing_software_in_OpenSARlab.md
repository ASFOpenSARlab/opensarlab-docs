# Installing Software in OpenSARlab

## pip
You can install pip packages to your /home/jovyan/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages directory with the following command:
- python -m pip install --user package_name

It is important to use the  --user argument. This will install the package to your .local directory, avoiding any permission issues, and insuring that the package installation will persist when the OpenSARlab server restarts (so you don't have to reinstall it every time). 

Note that pip packages in the .local directory will supersede other versions of the same package installed elsewhere.   

## apt and apt-get
Users cannot install software in OpenSARlab using apt or apt-get.

## conda
Users can install additional software with conda in OpenSARlab, but it will not persist after the sever shuts down. It will need to be reinstalled during subsequent OpenSARlab sessions. 

**Install conda packages from within a notebook**

- %conda install package_name

**Install conda packages from the terminal**

- conda install package_name

Note: it is also possible to [create and use new conda environments in OpenSARlab](conda_environments.md)

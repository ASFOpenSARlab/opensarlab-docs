# JupyterLab Extensions
<br>

As an OpenScienceLab user, you have limited access to third-party extensions.

- Server extensions must be installed in the OpenSARLab Docker container and cannot be installed by users.
- Lab extensions can be installed, enabled, and disabled from the terminal but they will not persist across server restarts and will need to be reinstalled.

:::{note} Request an extension

If you feel that OpenSARLab is lacking an important Jupyter Lab extension, please contact us to request it at <uaf-jupyterhub-asf@alaska.edu>

If you would like an extension added to a custom lab, we will need approval from the lab owner before installing it.

Users sometimes need to use an interactive shell to organize their accounts. With OpenScienceLabâ€™s built-in terminal, users can use an interactive shell to accomplish their tasks.

## **How to Open a Terminal**

1. If there is no `Launcher` tab in your workspace, open one by clicking the blue `+` button at the upper left of the screen.

## **No Root Privileges**

Because the `jovyan` does not have a password, OpenScienceLab users cannot use the `sudo` command.

# Class and Custom Labs
<br>

Custom labs are created for specific uses, such as hosting a class or a research team working on a project.

## Cloud Resources in Custom Labs

The resources provided in custom labs are based on the anticipated needs of a given user group and often differ from those provided in OpenSARLab. Requests for changes to compute and storage resources must be approved by the owner of a custom lab. This is typically a professor, workshop host, or PI on a grant-funded project.

## Custom Lab Access

Access to all custom labs is determined by the owner of each lab. Professors, instructors, or PIs should provide instructions for accessing a custom lab. Access will require an [OpenScienceLab account](opensciencelab_accounts.md). 

Once a user's OpenScienceLab account has been given access to a lab, a lab access card will appear in the OpenScienceLab portal after signing in.

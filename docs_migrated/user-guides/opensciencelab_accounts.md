# OpenScienceLab Accounts

OpenScienceLab is a single-sign-on portal providing access to ASF-managed JupyterHubs such as OpenSARLab. OpenScienceLab hosts labs for research projects, classes, and workshops. If you are attending a class or workshop, your instructor will provide details for gaining access to the lab.  

ASF provides limited access to OpenSARLab. NASA-affiliates are granted access upon request. All others may apply for access by completing the [OpenSARLab Access Application](https://forms.gle/LNBCwe8JohYitvfy6).

Labs in OpenScienceLab are independent. If you have access to multiple labs, each will have its own storage volume and you cannot copy data directly from one to another. 

Be mindful to use the correct lab for a given event. They are configured to support expected workflows.

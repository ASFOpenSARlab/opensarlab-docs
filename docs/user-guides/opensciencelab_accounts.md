# OpenScienceLab Accounts  
<br>

OpenScienceLab is a single-sign-on portal providing access to ASF-managed JupyterHubs such as OpenSARLab. OpenScienceLab also hosts labs for research projects, classes, and workshops. If you are attending a class or workshop, your instructor will provide details for gaining access to the lab. 

:::{note}
ASF provides limited access to OpenSARLab. NASA-affiliates are granted access upon [request](mailto:uso@asf.alaska.edu?subject=NASA-affiliate%20OSL%20access%20request). All others may apply for access by completing the OpenSARLab Access Application

:::{tip}
Labs in OpenScienceLab are independent and do not share resources:
- If you have access to multiple labs, each will have its own storage volume and you cannot copy data directly from one to another. 
- Be mindful to use the correct lab for a given event. They are configured to support expected workflows.

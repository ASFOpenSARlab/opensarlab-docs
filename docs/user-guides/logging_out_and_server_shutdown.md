# Logging Out of OpenSARlab and Shutting Down the Server

When you are ready to stop working in OpenSARlab, it is important to shut down your server and also logout.

## Why Shut Down the Server?

<!--  in future, include docs regarding auto shutdown and reference it here -->

Logging out will not shut down the server on its own. While the server may shut down automatically after an hour of inactivity, user should not rely on this feature. 

While there are any notebooks open in active browser tabs, the server will stay alive.

<!-- typo: logged out, and decied (sic) to log back -->
*Example:* Consider a case where you ran some process, logged out, and decided to log back in for the first time in a few days. Upon logging in, you noticed that the Jupyter Notebook from the previous session is still running. This implies that your server was running for the past few days, which used up unnecessary resources.

Do your part to reduce resource use and ease the burden on the environment by shutting down your server when you are finished working for the day. 

**In some instances, you may need to leave your server running. For example, you have a notebook performing a very time intensive analysis and wish to let it run overnight. It is acceptable for you to keep your server running in cases like this.**

*Summary: Unless you intend to run your server for a long period of time, make sure to shut it down before your leave.*

# June 2025

Welcome to the June 2025 OpenScienceLab Update!

### Changes:

We've upgraded our documentation to use [Jupyter Book version 2](https://jupyterbook.org/)!

We've also updated the documentation to better reflect the current state of
OpenScienceLab -- please note that the Developer Documentation is quite out of date and
we are planning on a complete re-write in the future.
